Twitter timeline logger for ttytter
===================================

download and unpack twitter archive
run cleanup.sh from unpacked directory
patch oysttyer to use JSON library (needs to be installed):
# or use decode-json branch of github.com/alech/oysttyer
patch oysttyer.pl oysttyer_json_lib_decode.patch
start oysttyer with extension:
ttytter.pl -ssl -dostream -exts=oysttyer_logger.pl -extpref_logger_dest=/path/to/twitter_archive
...
load /path/to/twitter_archive/index.html in browser
[...]
PROFIT :)

Can be used with -notimeline and -track to create an archive of a search, too.

TODO: split archive into daily files in order to make loading of archives
not take in the order of minutes ...
